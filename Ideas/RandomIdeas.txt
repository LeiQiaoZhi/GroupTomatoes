Just put down random ideas


1. Location-based Instagram
   > post photos to the location where the photo was taken
   > view photos taken by others based on location (just like browsing nearby restaurants in Google Map)
   > like posts/ save posts/ follow accounts (just like Instagram)
   
   e.g. a professional took an amazing photo of the cat in RJ canteen, he posts it 
   on our app with a description(how he took the photo, how he found the cat, how cute the cat is, etc.).
   Users can see the post represented by a dot in the main page(a map view) pinpointed at the location of RJ canteen, 
   clicking on the dot, users can view the full post(the photo, the description, the uploader, etc.)
   
   The point of the whole app is to let people discover how beautiful their ordinary surroundings can be in photos, 
   and for photographers to post their work in a different and interesting way.
